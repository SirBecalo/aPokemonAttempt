# aPokemonAttempt
#there_was_an_attempt to make a pokemon game using what i learned on codecademy and browsing docs(Python, Flask, SQL/Alchemy, Sqlite/Postgressql, beautiful soup, wtforms, and many others!

this is my first time using github, so please excuse me if i seem unfamilliar with etiqquete or so :/ (i AM unfammmiliar :D )

this is a for fun project, been trying to make a pokemon game for a while using tkinter for gui and that failed misserably :D heres to hoping flask and html help my coding journey!

i am intending on integrating JS to make the game more interactive when i do learn it. right now i guess the game will be as static as a lightning bolt.
